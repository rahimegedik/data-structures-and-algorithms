# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains examples of basic data structures and algorithms written in Java. These works, which I carried out as school projects, serve as an introduction to data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### LinkedList
- **Single Linked List:** Implementations of singly linked lists.
- **Double Linked List:** Implementations of doubly linked lists.

### Stack
- You can find stack implementations and examples in this section.

## Algorithms

### Search Algorithms
- **Binary Search:** Fast searching in sorted arrays.
- **Linear Search:** Searching an array from start to finish.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** Examples of bubble sort algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort:** Examples of insertion sort algorithm.
- **Merge Sort:** Examples of merge sort algorithm.
- **Quick Sort:** Examples of quick sort algorithm.
- **Selection Sort:** Examples of selection sort algorithm.
